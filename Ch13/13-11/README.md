Design a PayRoll class that has data members for an employeeâ€™s hourly pay rate,
number of hours worked, and total pay for the week. Write a program with an array of
seven PayRoll objects. The program should ask the user for the number of hours each
employee has worked and will then display the amount of gross pay each has earned.
Input Validation: Do not accept values greater than 60 for the number of hours
worked.
